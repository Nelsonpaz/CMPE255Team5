The raw dataset has outputs from 8 people doing 19 different activitities for 5 minutes each.
The data gathered was from 9 sensors per location (5 locations total), for a total of 45 sensor 
axes at a frequency of 25Hz. Each 5 minute dataset was broken up into 480 5-second 
segments. Therefore there are 45 attributes and 125 rows per 5-second file for each of the 8 
individuals and for each of the 19 activities.
