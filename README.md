***CODE Evaluation***

1) Dowload and Upload the "TEAM5 - Daily And Sports Activities Prediction - PROFESSOR Version.ipynb" to Jupiter Notebook
2) Add the following files to the same directory:
    # X_train_p.txt
    # y_train_p.txt
    # X_test_p.txt
    # y_test_p.txt
3) Left Click on Kernel. & Restart and Run All. 

The Code will import the necessary Libraries and the perform Two types of Classification: 

_First:_ Artificial Neural Newwork Model: 3 Types (two, three and tour layes)

_Second:_ Random Forest Classifier. 


**About the Original Data:** 

Dataset used for this project is from UCI Machine Learning Repository

The raw dataset has outputs from 8 people doing 19 different activitities for 5 minutes each.
The data gathered was from 9 sensors per location (5 locations total), for a total of 45 sensor 
axes at a frequency of 25Hz. Each 5 minute dataset was broken up into 480 5-second 
segments. Therefore there are 45 attributes and 125 rows per 5-second file for each of the 8 
individuals and for each of the 19 activities.
